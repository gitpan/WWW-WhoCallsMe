NAME
    WWW::WhoCallsMe - Query WhoCallsMe.com for details about a caller's
    phone number

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::WhoCallsMe;
      my $who = WWW::WhoCallsMe->new;

      my $number = '6305053008';
      my $calledme = $who->fetch($number);
      if ($calledme->{listed})
      {
        my $name = $calledme->{name};
        print "The number $number is listed.  ";
        print "It seems that $name was calling." if $name;
        print "I don't know who was calling, though." unless $name;
        print "\n";
      }

        print "This number is not listed.\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    WhoCallsMe.com is a website that compiles reports from users about
    companies that call people. These callers might be telemarketers, bill
    collectors, legit companies, or otherwise. These reports are filed by
    the person that received the call. In some cases, the report includes
    the name of the company that called. This module attempts to grab this
    information and report it back to your program.

    You supply the phone number and it tells you if the number is listed,
    what names have been reported for this number, and a guess at the
    company name of the caller.

  new
      my $who = WWW::WhoCallsMe->new;

    Accepts no parameters.

    Returns a new WWW::WhoCallsMe object for your enjoyment.

  fetch
      my $hashref = $who->fetch($number);

    Accepts one *required* argument: the phone number.

    Returns a hashref containing this information:

    *   number - scalar: the number that was queried

    *   success - scalar: whether or not the HTTP query succeeded

    *   listed - scalar: determines if the number is listed

    *   name - scalar: the guessed name of the caller (based on frequency of
        occurrences in the callername array)

    *   callername - array: list of reported caller names (the "Caller:"
        field)

    *   callerid - array: list of reported caller id values (the "Caller
        ID:" field)
